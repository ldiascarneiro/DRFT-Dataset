## 📝 Schema (Fields)
Each row in the `.xlsx` dataset contains:

- **base_text** → Full text of the initial submission  
- **review** → Concatenated peer-review comments/meta-review  
- **final_text** → Final version (arXiv)  
- **source** → Data source (ICLR/OpenReview, PeerRead)  
- **bertscore** → Semantic similarity score (draft ↔ final)  
- **g_eval_score** → Review uptake score (1–10)  
- **g_eval_justification** → Short justification generated by GPT-5o-mini

## 🔧 Usage
Typical research use cases include:
1. **Review-conditioned edit planning**  
   Generate structured edit plans based on review feedback.  
2. **Evaluating automatic revisions**  
   Benchmark against human final versions using BERTScore + G-Eval.  
3. **Analyzing review facets**  
   Study how specific feedback drives textual changes.

## ⚖️ Ethical and Legal Considerations
- All materials are **publicly available** (ICLR/OpenReview, PeerRead, arXiv).  
- Reviewer anonymity is preserved.  
- Redistribution respects platform terms: where redistribution is restricted, stable IDs and retrieval scripts are provided.  
- **Intended use:** research on review-grounded rewriting, revision quality, and review uptake.  
- **Out of scope:** acceptance prediction, reviewer scoring, deanonymization, or private inference.
